**OBJECTIVE-C SNIPPETS README**

In this repository, you will find snippets of Objective-C code I have found useful and felt were worth sharing with others. I hope that it will be of some use to you as you work on your own projects. Feel free to let me know if you do find anything contained here useful, as it's always exciting to hear about the work of others.

I plan to continue improving these snippets if I find useful improvements, and will add to this repo over time with more examples of potentially useful code.

Thanks for taking a look here, and enjoy!
